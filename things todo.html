                 <p>As previously mentioned, Vintar is home to one of the biggest convents in Ilocos Norte that houses the Saint Nicolas Institute. An earthquake in 1931 partially destroyed the convent and its church, but the buildings were restored 5 years later. By visiting this attraction, 
                    you will get a glimpse of the townâ€™s rich history .</p>
